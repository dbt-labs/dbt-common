# The classes in this file represent the data necessary to describe a
# particular event to both human readable logs, and machine reliable
# event streams. classes extend superclasses that indicate what
# destinations they are intended for, which mypy uses to enforce
# that the necessary methods are defined.


# Event codes have prefixes which follow this table
#
# | Code |     Description     |
# |:----:|:-------------------:|
# | A    | Pre-project loading |
# | D    | Deprecations        |
# | E    | DB adapter          |
# | I    | Project parsing     |
# | M    | Deps generation     |
# | P    | Artifacts           |
# | Q    | Node execution      |
# | W    | Node testing        |
# | Z    | Misc                |
# | T    | Test only           |
#
# The basic idea is that event codes roughly translate to the natural order of running a dbt task

# formatting to be written to the console, while they can be ignored for other purposes. For
# general information that isn't simple formatting, the Note event should be used instead.
