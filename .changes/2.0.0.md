## dbt-common 2.0.0 - May 19, 2025

### Fixes

- Ensure event manager doesn't break if `WARN_ERROR_OPTIONS` global is overwritten with `WarnErrorOptionsV2` object ([#283](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-common/issues/283))


### Under the Hood

- Centralize event definitions for dbt-common, dbt-adapters, and dbt-core into a central repository. This major re-organization of events requires a major version release. ([#285](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-common/issues/285))
