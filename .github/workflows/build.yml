# **what?**
# Verifies python build on all code commited to the repository. This workflow
# should not require any secrets since it runs for PRs from forked repos. By
# default, secrets are not passed to workflows running from a forked repos.

# **why?**
# Ensure code for dbt meets a certain quality standard.

# **when?**
# This will run for all PRs, when code is pushed to main, and when manually triggered.
